# JLODA library version 2

This is new release of the JLODA "java library of datastructures and algorithm", implemented by Daniel Huson 2002-2023.

All Java programmings under guthub.com/husonlab will be refactored to use MAVEN for package management.

This is in testing phase and will change substantially over the next couple of months (until Feb 2023).
