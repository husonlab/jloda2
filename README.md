# JLODA library version 2

This is new release of the JLODA "java library of datastructures and algorithm", implemented by Daniel Huson 2002-2023.

This is in testing phase and will change substantially over the next couple of months (until Feb 2023).

I am writing a new set of programs that will use this library via MAVEN.
